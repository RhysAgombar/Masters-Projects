Projects for my CS Master's Degree

Woe be unto thee who looketh upon this repo. I'll eventually get around to documenting what each folder contains, but until then, here's what I think are the most important.

Computer Vision Lab - a pytorch implementation of https://github.com/StevenLiuWen/ano_pred_cvpr2018

Deep Learning Lab - a slightly modified version of https://github.com/Tushar-N/attributes-as-operators

Deep Learning Final Project - a modified DCGAN implementation, plus SVM code for generating images and classifying images using features extracted from the DCGAN.
