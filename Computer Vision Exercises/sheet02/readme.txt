Implement your solution in the file sheet01.py in the src directory.
The necessary python modules files are already imported.
Your program should run from the terminal with the following command:

python src/template.py

Please provide any other information required to run your program here...

The program will occasionally pause from time to time. This was intentional, with waitkey calls being added to pause the execution and allow for the inspection of the output between each task's section.
The code was broken up into multiple files to improve readability, but only template.py needs to be executed to run them all.
